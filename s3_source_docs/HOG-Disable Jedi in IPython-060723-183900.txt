Disable Jedi in IPython
According to the jupyter-lsp project it is recommended to disable the Jedi auto completer.
GitHub - krassowski/jupyterlab-lsp: Coding assistance for JupyterLab (code navigation + hover suggestions + linters + autocompletion + 
rename) using Language Server Protocol 
 
(Optional, IPython users only) to improve the performance of autocompletion, disable Jedi in IPython (the LSP servers for Python use Jedi 
too). You can do that temporarily with:
%config Completer.use_jedi = False
or permanently by setting c.Completer.use_jedi = False in your ipython_config.py file. You will also benefit from using experimental version 
of python-language-server as described in the Note 2 (above).
 
I modified the following configuration file
I then check in JupyterLab Notebook if the configuration took effect.
 
This returned
 
This works fine for the kernel Python 3 (ipykernel)
However it does not for Python 3.8 (XPython)

Experimental: Use Jedi to generate autocompletions. Default to True if jedi
is installed.
Current: False
