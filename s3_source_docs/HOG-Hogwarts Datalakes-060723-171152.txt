Getting started
What is a Datalake?
A datalake (a.k.a Storage Account) is Microsoft's object storage solution for the cloud.  Blob storage is optimized for storing massive 
amounts of unstructured data. Unstructured data is data that doesn't adhere to a particular data model or definition, such as text or binary 
data.
Azure Data Lake includes all the capabilities required to make it easy for developers, data scientists, and analysts to store data of any size, 
shape, and speed, and do all types of processing and analytics across platforms and languages.
What are the available Datalakes and Containers?
Here is a description of the different containers (and the permissions applied):
data: no access for alpr-members-sg.  Used for transitory un-processed data (for example: data downloaded from Internet that will be 
loaded into a production Hive table)
warehouse: read-only to alpr-members-sg.  Holds the production Hive table and underlying parquet files.  This is default hive metastore 
location when none is specified.
users: full access to alpr-members-sg.  This is your playground space, we highly recommend that you create a folder with your 
username underneath this container to store any data or files that you use to develop your analytics.  Please note that all members of 
alpr-members-sg can read/modify files and folders stored in that container.
analytics: full access to alpr-members-sg.  This is to store the input and results of your production analytics.  Please create a 
meaningful folder structure within that container. Please note that all members of alpr-members-sg can read/modify files and folders Unclass hogwartsdatalakeu data, warehouse

If you need to create another container (for example to further restrict access permissions) please contact us for instructions.
Accessing the Datalake
How to access the Hogwarts Datalake through the Azure portal?
Visit the Unclassified datalake portal or the PB datalake portal
How to access the Hogwarts Datalake using Spark?
Please refer to the Spark User Guide for an example.

How to access the Datalake using Azure CLI?
Here is an example to list all the containers that you have access to in the hogwartsdatalakeu:
For a list of other storage commands, try out to az storage --help or visit https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/storage?
view=azure-cli-latest
How to access the Datalake using the Azure REST API?
Please refer to: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/data-lake-storage-gen2 
How to copy files from/to the Datalake?
Azure has a tool called azcopy that can be used for that purpose: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-ref-
azcopy?toc=/azure/storage/blobs/toc.json   
Advanced topics
RBAC and ACL permissions on container/folder/file
Azure provides 2 ways to secure your files and folders: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Access Contol List (ACL).

2az login
az storage container list --account-name hogwartsdatalakeu --subscription Chimera-U --auth-mode loginThe smallest granularity for RBAC is at the container level and this will be evaluated at a higher priority than ACLs. Therefore, if you assign 
a role to a security principal in the scope of a container, that security principal has the authorization level associated with that role for ALL 
directories and files in that container, regardless of ACL assignments.
It is therefore important to note that all ALPR users have read+write access to the users and analytics containers which means that 
they can see/modify all files stored in those containers. 
If you need to restrict permissions on a folder that contains sensitive information, please contact us for guidance.
