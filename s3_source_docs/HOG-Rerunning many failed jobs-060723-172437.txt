Rerunning many failed jobs
Step-by-step
1. Navigate to the DAG run list page
From any Airflow page, click on the Menu tab “Browse” then select “DAG runs”
You should now see a page that looks like this:
2. Select the DAG runs you wish to re-run by using filters
First, click on the “Search” button at the top left of the page, then click “Add Filter” to start filtering your DAG runs.
Add the following filters:
Dag Id → “Equal to” → <insert_your_dag_id_here>
State → “Equal to” → “failed”
If you want to target a specific date range, use the following filters:
Execution Date → “Greater than” → <execution_date_min>
Execution Date → “Smaller than” → <execution_date_max>
Note: You must click “Add filter” each time you want to add a new filter to your select.
 
Here is what your screen should look like before searching:As always, if you run into any issues while following this guide, please let us know in our Hogwarts support channel!
When you’re ready, click the “Search” button to select your DAG runs.
3. Clearing the states of selected DAG runs
Now that you’ve successfully selected your DAG runs, you must clear their state. Be warned though, this will rerun every task for these 
DAG runs.
To clear their state, do the following:
Select all DAG runs in the list. You can easily do this by clicking the top left square of the list.
click on the “Actions” button on the list toolbar and select “Clear the state”
If you have a large amount of DAG runs to rerun, make sure to change the page size to 100! You can do so by using the “Page size” 
button in the toolbar.
 
Tada! Airflow will swing into action and rerun all of these jobs.
 
Note: If your DAG runs very often, it can be hard to see the progress of old DAG runs as they might be hidden from the Tree & 
Graph views. 
We suggest that you reuse the filters used above without the State=failed criteria to monitor their progress!
