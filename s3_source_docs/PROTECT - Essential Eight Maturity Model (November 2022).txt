Introduction  
The Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) has developed prioritised mitigation strategies, in the form of the 
Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents , to help organisations protect themselves against various cyber 
threats.  The most effective of these mitigation strategies are the Essential Eight.  
The Es sential Eight has been  designed  to protect Microsoft Windows -based internet -connected networks. While the 
principles behind the  Essential Eight  may be applied to  cloud services and enterprise mobility , or other operating 
systems , it was not primarily desig ned for such purposes and alternative  mitigation strategies may be more appropriate  
to mitigate unique cyber threats to these environments . In such cases, organisations should  consider alternative 
guidance provided  by the ACSC.  
The Essential Eight Maturity Model , first published in June 2017 and updated regularly, support s the implement ation 
of the Essential Eight. It is based on the ACSC’s experience in producing cyber threat intelligence, responding to cyber 
security incidents, conducting penetration testing and assisting organisations to implement the Essential Eight.  
Implementation  
When implementing the Essential Eight, o rganisations should  identify  and plan for  a target maturity level suitable  for 
their environment . Organisations should then progressively implement  each  maturity level  until that target  is achieved . 
As the  mitigation strategies that constitute the  Essential Eight ha ve been designed to complement each other, and to 
provide coverage of various  cyber threats, o rganisations should plan their implementation  to achieve the same 
maturity level across all eight mitigation stra tegies before moving onto higher maturity level s. 
Organisations should implement the Essential Eight using a risk -based approach. In doing so, o rganisations should seek 
to minimise any exceptions  and their scope , for example , by implementing  compensating security controls and ensuring 
the number of systems or users impacted are minimised . In addition , any exceptions should be  documented and 
approved through an appropriate process . Subsequently,  the need for any exceptions , and associated  comp ensating 
security controls , should be  monitored and reviewed  on a regular basis . Note, t he appropriate use of exceptions should 
not preclude  an organisation from being assessed as meeting  the requirements for a given maturity level.  
As the Essential Eight outlines  a minimum set of preventative measures, organisations need to implement additional 
measures to those within this maturity model where it is warranted by their environment. Further, w hile the Essential 
Eight can help to mitigate the majority of cyb er threats, it will not mitigate all cyber threats. As such, additional 
mitigation strategies and security controls need to be considered, including those from  the Strategies to Mitigate 
Cyber Security Incidents  and the  Information Security Manual . Essential Eight  
Maturity Model  
First published:  June 2017  
Last updated:  November 2022   
 2 Finally, t here is no requirement for organisations to have their Essential Eight implementatio n certified by an 
independent party . However, Essential Eight implementations  may need to  be assessed by an independent party if  
required  by a government directive  or polic y, by a regulatory authority, or as part of contractual arrangements . 
Maturity levels  
To assist organisations with their implementation of the Essential Eight, four maturity levels have been defined  
(Maturity Level Zero through to Maturity Level Three) . With the exception of Maturity Level Zero, the maturity levels 
are based on mitig ating increasing  levels of adversary tradecraft (i.e. tools, tactics, techniques and procedures)  and 
targeting , which are discussed in more detail below. Depending on an adversary’s overall capability, they may exhibit 
different levels of tradecraft for di fferent operations against different targets. For example, an adversary capable of 
advanced tradecraft may use it against one target while using basic tradecraft against another. As such, organisations 
should consider what level of tradecraft and targeting , rather than which adversaries,  they are aiming to mitigate.  
Organisations need to consider that the likelihood of being targeted is influenced by their desirability to adversaries, 
and the consequences of a cyber security incident will depend on the ir requirement for the confidentiality of their data , 
as well as  their requirement for the availability and integrity of their systems  and data . This, in combination with the 
descriptions for each maturity level, can be used to help determine a target maturity level to implement . 
Finally , Maturity Level Three will not stop adversar ies that are willing and able to invest enough time, money and effort 
to compromise a target . As such , organisations still need to consider the remainder of the mitigation strategies f rom 
the Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents  and the  Information Security Manual . 
Maturity Level Zero  
This maturity level signifies that there are  weakness es in an or ganisation ’s overall cyber security posture . When 
exploited, these weaknesses  could facilitate the compromise of the confidentiality  of their data, or the  integrity or 
availability of their systems  and data , as described by the tradecraft and targeting in Maturity Level One below.  
Maturity Level One  
The focus of this maturity level is adversaries who  are content to simply leverage commodity  tradecraft  that is widely 
available in order to gain access  to, and likely control of, systems. For example, adversar ies opportunistically using a 
publicly -available exploit for a security vulnerability in an internet -facing service which had  not been patched, or 
authenticating to an internet -facing service using credentials that were stolen, reused, brute forced or guess ed. 
Generally, adversaries are looking for any victim rather than a specific  victim  and will opportunistically seek common 
weaknesses in many targets rather than investing heavily in gaining access to a specific  target. Adversaries  will employ 
common socia l engineering techniques to trick users into weakening the security of a system and launch malicious 
applications, for example via Microsoft Office macros. If the account that an adversary  compromise s has special 
privileges they will seek to exploit it. De pending on their intent, adversar ies may also destroy data  (including backups).  
Maturity Level Two  
The focus of this maturity level is adversaries operating with a modest step -up in capability from the previous maturity 
level. These adversaries are willing  to invest more time in a target and, perhaps more importantly, in the effectiveness 
of their tools. For example, these adversaries  will likely employ well -known tradecraft  in order to better attempt to 
bypass security controls implemented by  a target and evade detection. This includes actively targeting credentials using 
phishing and employing technical and social engineering techniques to circumvent weak multi -factor authentication.  
Generally, adversaries are likely to be more selective in their targeting  but still somewhat conservative in the time , 
money and effort they may invest in a target. Adversaries  will likely invest time to ensure their phishing is effective and  
 3 employ common social engineering techniques to trick users to weaken the security of a  system and launch malicious 
applications, for example via Microsoft Office macros. If the account that an adversary  compromise s has special 
privileges they will seek to exploit it, otherwise they will seek accounts with special privileges. Depending on th eir 
intent, adversar ies may also destroy all data  (including backups) accessible  to an account with special privileges.  
Maturity Level Three  
The focus of this maturity level is adversaries  who  are more adaptive and much less reliant on public tools and 
techniques. These  adversaries  are able to exploit the opportunities provided by weaknesses in their target’s cyber 
security posture, such as  the existence of older software or inadequate logging and monitoring. Adversaries  do this to 
not only extend their access once initial access  has been gained to a target , but to evade detection and solidify their 
presence. Adversaries  make swift use of exploits when they become publicly available as well as o ther tradecraft that 
can improve their chance of success.  
Generally, adversaries may be more focused on particular targets  and, more importantly , are willing and able to invest 
some effort in to circumventing the idiosyncrasies and particular policy and tec hnical security controls implemented by 
their targets. For example, this includes social engineering a user to not only open a malicious document but also to 
unknowingly assist  in bypass ing security controls. This can also include circumventing stronger mu lti-factor 
authentication by stealing authentication token values to impersonate a user. Once a foothold is gained on a system , 
adversaries  will seek to gain privileged credentials or password hashes, pivot to other parts of a network, and cover 
their trac ks. Depending on their intent, adversar ies may  also destroy all data  (including backups).  
Requirements for each maturity level  
Requirements for Maturity Level One through to Maturity Level Three are outlined in Appendices A to C. A comparison 
of the maturi ty levels, with changes between maturity levels indicated via bolded text, is outlined in Appendix D.
