Introduction  
The Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) has developed prioritised mitigation strategies, in the form of the 
Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents , to help organisations protect themselves against various cyber 
threats. The most effective of these mitigation strategies are the Essential Eight.  
The Es sential Eight has been designed to protect Microsoft Windows -based internet -connected networks. While the 
principles behind the Essential Eight may be applied to cloud services and enterprise mobility, or other operating 
systems, it was not primarily desig ned for such purposes and alternative mitigation strategies may be more appropriate 
to mitigate unique cyber threats to these environments . 
The Essential Eight  
The mitigation strategies that constitute  the Essential Eight are:  
 application control  
 patch applications  
 configure Microsoft Office macro  settings  
 user application hardening  
 restrict administrative privileges  
 patch operating systems  
 multi -factor authentication  
 regular backups.
