Job Editor Changes
Introduction
Coming to SPELLBOOK in version 1.7.0 are a couple new changes to the job editor including a Markdown editor and a Diff editor.
Markdown Editor
The new markdown editor will allow users to save a markdown file alongside their DAG files in order to provide additional documentation on 
the specific job. This new editor comes with the ability to render the markdown in browser for easier viewing. Whenever a new job is created 
or a DAG is adopted, a markdown file will be created and saved alongside the DAG. For existing jobs, a markdown file will be created the 
first time the user navigates to the job editor. This markdown can then be viewed and edited by switching to the markdown view tab on the 
job editor.
Similar to the DAG editor, a markdown file can be uploaded to the editor by switching into edit mode and drag-and-dropping the file into the 
editor. Also, the file can be downloaded by clicking the download button. In order to view the rendered markdown, simply click the View 
Rendered Markdown button.
Diff Editor
Also coming in SPELLBOOK version 1.7.0 is the Diff editor. This view allows users to compare their unsaved changes to the original DAG 
or markdown file. This can be easily toggled on and off by using the view changes button while in edit mode.
