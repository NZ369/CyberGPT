What is a Filter set?
Filter sets allow you to save a predefined state for the filters in a dashboard. For example, if a dashboard has a time filter, and filters on the 
last 24 hours by default, you can create a filter set that would instead allow you to filter on whatever time period you wanted (such as the 
last 72 hours). However, filter sets become very useful for times when you are working with dashboards that have multiple filters, and you 
would like to have multiple pre-defined configurations of the filters.
